# Demo: Publishing a reading-notes repo

Here are the steps required to create a reading repo GitHub site.

### Steps to follow

1. You'll need to be signed into GitHub
1. Create a new repo, named `reading-notes`
    - If you already have something there, move it, or use a burner account.
1. Include a README when making the repo
1. Publish with GH pages, pick a theme you like
1. Check out your fancy new live site!
    - Raw content visible at: `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/reading-notes/README.md`
    - Rendered, themed page at: `https://USERNAME.github.io/reading-notes/`
1. Modify the Markdown, and see the changes get deployed (after about a min)
1. Convert the content into a home page for a reading-notes
    - Briefly introduce yourself, and link to your GitHub profile
    - Explain what the site is about (it's a reading-notes)
    - Explain Growth Mindset in your own words
    - New pages will be added to the site as we learn new things
